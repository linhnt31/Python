- A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.


# Advantages and disadvantages between DLL and single linked list

- Advantages: 
    1. A DLL can be traversed in both forward and backward direction.
    2. The delete operation in DLL is more efficient if pointer to the node to be deleted is given.
    3. We can quickly insert a new node before a given node.

- Disadvantages:
    1. Require extra space for operations
